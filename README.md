# Arabic-text-clasification
Working on an Arabic text classification project on using machine learning, with a focus on support vector machines (SVM). The preprocessing involved several key steps: removing punctuation, URLs, and English letters; normalizing the Arabic text; eliminating repeating characters; and stemming words. Additionally, tokenization and stopword removal were applied to clean up the data. Features were then extracted using TF-IDF vectorization. This processed data was used to train the SVM model, significantly improving the accuracy of Arabic text categorization.
