# Arabic-text-clasification
Developed an Arabic text classification project utilizing machine learning, with an emphasis on support vector machines (SVM). Preprocessing steps included punctuation removal, URL and English letter elimination, Arabic text normalization, removal of repeating characters, word stemming, tokenization, and stopword removal. Employed TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction. The SVM model trained on this processed data showed a significant improvement in categorizing Arabic texts, underscoring the effectiveness of tailored preprocessing in natural language processing (NLP) for Arabic. The dataset included diverse modern Arabic texts from newspaper articles.
